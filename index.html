							</span>
							<p>
								I am a current PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and received my B.Sc. in physics from Northeastern University in 2021. I am broadly interested in instrumentation and exoplanet high-contrast imaging, and am part of the SCALES (Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy) instrument team. Outside of research, I am frequently sunburnt and out of breath somewhere remote, and I've been a competitive fencer for 15 years.

							<p>
							I deeply believe that science must be accessible and inclusive, which takes active and thoughful work 
							to make happen. I spend time on general astronomy outreach to the public, mentoring physics & astronomy 
							undergraduate students, and cultivating positive work dynamics within my home department.
							</p>
								
							<p><b>Mentorship:</b></p>	
							<p> 
							I support three UCSC physics undergraduate students. In weekly individual meetings, we connect over the 
							lived experience of being a woman in physics, and I try to provide them with the support and connections they 
							need to create their own success.
							</p>

							<p><b>Public outreach:</b></p>	
							<p>
							Science is at its most valuable when it is shared in an understandable, empowering way with non-experts. 
							I aim to give one public talk per quarter about general astronomy and my research. I've previously been hosted 
							by local elementary, middle, and high schools, and local Astronomy on Tap events. I also respond to public 
							questions via Lick Observatory's AskAnAstronomer.
							</p>

<!-- 							<p>
								<b>Mentorship:</b>
								High-quality mentorship has been crucial to helping me develop as a student and researcher,
								and I'm committed to paying it forward. I'm part of the first-year mentorship program
								with the Northeastern physics department, and try to support my peers, especially women and
								those interested in astronomy research, however I can: sharing my
								experiences with research, connecting them to my network, and helping them navigate internships,
								academics, and life in the physics department.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								Our beliefs about what we're capable of start to solidify in early elementary school, and when so many
								kids don't have exposure to STEM at that age, they miss out on the confidence and personal enrichment
								that scientific thinking can bring. I'm passionate about doing STEM outreach to elementary school classrooms,
								especially those in public schools, not just to recruit future scientists but to bolster kids' confidence in
								their abilities, inspire them to set ambitious goals, and use scientific thinking to achieve them.
