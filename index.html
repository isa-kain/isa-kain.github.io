							<p>
								<b>Education:</b>
								Currently I am an undergraduate at Northeastern University studying physics.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								I am broadly interested in observational exoplanet astronomy, and enjoy a blended approach of
								both science and engineering. On the science side, my previous work
								was with characterising planet migration and system dynamics from transit photometry. On
								the engineering side, I have worked on systems engineering to support exoplanet imaging missions,
								including the Orbiting Starshade and Orbiting Configurable Artificial Star (ORCAS) missions.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b> Personal Interests:</b>
								I've been a competitive fencer for 12 years, and also enjoy hiking, kayaking, traveling, and woodworking
								(the picture here is from a hiking trip to Costa Rica!).

								<b>Mentorship:</b>
								High-quality mentorship has been crucial to helping me develop as a student and researcher,
								and I'm committed to paying it forward. I'm part of the first-year mentorship program
								with the Northeastern physics department, and try to support my peers, especially women and
								those interested in astronomy research, however I can: sharing my
								experiences with research, connecting them to my network, and helping them navigate internships,
								academics, and life in the phyhsics department.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								Our beliefs about what we're capable of start to solidify in early elementary school, and when so many
								kids don't have exposure to STEM at that age, they miss out on the confidence and personal enrichment
								that scientific thinking can bring. I'm passionate about doing STEM outreach to elementary school classrooms,
								especially those in public schools, not just to recruit future scientists, but to bolster kids' confidence in
								their abilities, inspire them to set ambitious goals, and use scientific thinking to achieve them.
