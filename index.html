							<p>
								<b>Education:</b>
								Currently I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Northeastern University majoring in physics,
								with minors in math and geology.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								I am broadly interested in observational exoplanet astronomy, and enjoy a blended approach of
								both science and engineering. On the science side, my previous work
								has included characterising planet migration and system dynamics from transit photometry. On
								the engineering side, I have worked on systems engineering to support exoplanet imaging missions,
								including the Orbiting Starshade and Orbiting Configurable Artificial Star (ORCAS) missions.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b> Personal Interests:</b>
								I've been a competitive fencer for 12 years, and also enjoy hiking, kayaking, traveling, and woodworking
								(the picture here is from a hiking trip to Costa Rica!).

								<b>Mentorship:</b>
								High-quality mentorship has been crucial to helping me develop as a student and researcher,
								and I'm committed to paying it forward. I'm part of the first-year mentorship program
								with the Northeastern physics department, and try to support my peers, especially women and
								those interested in astronomy research, however I can: sharing my
								experiences with research, connecting them to my network, and helping them navigate internships,
								academics, and life in the phyhsics department.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								Our beliefs about what we're capable of start to solidify in early elementary school, and when so many
								kids don't have exposure to STEM at that age, they miss out on the confidence and personal enrichment
								that scientific thinking can bring. I'm passionate about doing STEM outreach to elementary school classrooms,
								especially those in public schools, not just to recruit future scientists, but to bolster kids' confidence in
								their abilities, inspire them to set ambitious goals, and use scientific thinking to achieve them.

							<h2 class="major">Testing Electronic Prototypes for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)</h2>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/CMS.jpg" alt=""/>
							</span>
							<p>
								<b>Background:</b> <br>
								The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) runs dozens of particle physics
								experiments, among them the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. CMS is one of the
								experiments served by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and is one of two detectors which
								presented the first results for the Higgs boson. I worked on the electromagnetic
								calorimeter (ECAL) detector, one of several layers of detectors present in CMS.
								<br>
								The LHC periodically goes through long shutdown periods of 2 years, during which time
								the luminosity (corresponding to the energy of the proton-proton collisions) of the
								beamline is upgraded. To keep up with increased luminosity and combat degradation of
								the detector components due to extreme radiation, the experiments along the LHC’s beamline
								are upgraded as well. Worn electronics and detector components are ripped out and either
								replaced or upgraded.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Description of work:</b> <br>
								These new electronics need to be tested before they’re installed. This is where my work was
								focused: on developing a test environment for new electronics and calorimeters for the CMS ECAL.
								I worked with Dr. Giacomo Cucciati to develop H4DAQ, a data acquisition software which will be used
								at the H4 site along the SPS test beam. In this setup, particles arrive from the SPS test beam and
								pass through an alternating array of five hodoscopes and plastic scintillators, then through the test
								calorimeter, where the scintillation data is read by a VFE and FE array. Triggers from the hodoscopes
								and scintillators, warning signals from the SPS, and busy signals from the VFEs and FEs are fed into the
								trigger board, a CAEN DT 5495 multiple-FPGA unit, where an acquisition decision is made and passed to
								the run-control software.
								<br>
								During later iterations of this project, a VICE++ board was introduced for testing prototype VFE and FE
								boards. The full ECAL setup includes a data source (either photons from scintillation in a physical
								calorimeter, or simulated data), at least one full set of 5 VFE cards, at least one FE card per VFE set,
								and a complicated array of other electronics that are part of the data acquisition framework. The VICE++
								allows the cards being tested to be decoupled from the rest of the DAQ framework and from each other,
								so that one can test any combination of VFE and FE cards (including if some, or all, of one type of
								card is missing).
